# DEPINV
We design an online DEPression INterVention system (DEPINV), suitable for the online intervention of depressed woman suffering from fetal malformations. 
There are three main features in the design of DEPINV. 
First, it intends for the effective coordination and interaction among three types of user roles in order to reach a tripartite synergistic therapy effect. 
Second, it focuses on the assessment and monitoring of users’ psychological state, and the Accept Cognition Theory (ACT) is introduced into the design of the system for the intervention.
Third, various communication channels are provided to assist users’ coordination and ACT-based intervention.
